## Security Best Practices

When using XAKER in production:

- Keep dependencies up to date (`pip install --upgrade xaker`)
- Use virtual environments to isolate installations
- Do not expose model checkpoints or training data in public repositories
- Review configuration parameters before deploying to production
- Monitor for unusual memory or compute usage patterns

## Dependency Security

We use [Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot) to monitor dependencies for known vulnerabilities. Dependabot pull requests are reviewed and merged after CI passes.

## Scope

This security policy applies to the XAKER package distributed via PyPI and the source code in the official GitHub repository at [github.com/sachncs/xaker](https://github.com/sachncs/xaker).

It does not apply to:

- Third-party packages or services
