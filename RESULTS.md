## Complete Results (10/10 Benchmarks)

### Easy Synthetic Tasks

| Task | Seq Len | Standard Acc | Fused Acc | Standard Loss | Fused Loss | Slowdown |
|------|---------|--------------|-----------|---------------|------------|----------|
| Copy | 64 | 100.0% | 100.0% | 0.000130 | 0.000137 | 6.17x |
| Reversal | 32 | 100.0% | 100.0% | 0.0004 | 0.0007 | 3.69x |
| Induction | 48 | 100.0% | 100.0% | 0.0001 | 0.0001 | 7.26x |
| Addition | 32 | 97.36% | 96.95% | 0.1145 | 0.1337 | 5.19x |

### Hard Algorithmic Tasks

| Task | Seq Len | Standard Acc | Fused Acc | Standard Loss | Fused Loss | Slowdown |
|------|---------|--------------|-----------|---------------|------------|----------|
| Binding | 64 | 100.0% | 100.0% | 2.05e-05 | 1.94e-05 | 5.82x |
| Retrieval | 64 | 98.54% | 98.51% | 0.0982 | 0.1115 | 3.72x |
| Noisy Copy | 64 | 70.59% | 70.58% | 1.823 | 1.906 | 2.95x |

### Conditioning Analysis

| Task | Fused Condition Estimate |
|------|-------------------------|
| Reversal (32) | 21.61 |
| Induction (48) | 36.20 |
| Addition (32) | 40.91 |
| Noisy Copy (64) | 56.46 |
| Binding (64) | 66.39 |
| Copy (64) | 64.72 |
| Retrieval (64) | 87.41 |

**Note:** Standard attention has infinite condition estimate (no kernel regression).

### NLP Sentiment Classification

| Dataset | Seq Len | Standard Acc | Fused Acc | Standard Loss | Fused Loss |
|---------|---------|--------------|-----------|---------------|------------|
| Synthetic | 256 | 100.0% | 100.0% | 1.82e-06 | 2.94e-06 |

**Note:** Both models achieve perfect accuracy. Standard trains faster (93.4% → 100% by epoch 2 vs 71.5% → 100%).

### Long Sequence Scaling (Retrieval Task)

| Seq Len | Standard Acc | Fused Acc | Delta | Standard Loss | Fused Loss | Slowdown |
|---------|--------------|-----------|-------|---------------|------------|----------|
| 128 | 99.24% | 99.25% | +0.008% | 0.0396 | 0.0413 | 2.78x |
| 256 | 99.61% | 99.62% | +0.002% | 0.0181 | 0.0183 | 3.15x |

**Note:** Accuracy difference is negligible (<0.01%). Slowdown improves at longer sequences (better kernel amortization).

## Key Findings

### 1. No Accuracy Benefit
Across all 10 completed benchmarks:
- **Equal accuracy** on 9 tasks (both models achieve same performance)
- **Slightly worse** on Addition task (-0.41%)
- **Negligible improvement** on long sequence retrieval (+0.002-0.008%, within noise)
- **No meaningful task** where fused outperforms standard

### 2. Consistent Runtime Overhead
- **Average slowdown:** ~4-5x (short sequences), ~3x (longer sequences)
- **Range:** 2.78x to 7.26x
- **Lowest overhead:** Long sequence retrieval 256 tokens (3.15x) - better kernel amortization
- **Highest overhead:** Induction (7.26x)
- **Trend:** Slowdown decreases with sequence length (kernel computation amortized)

### 3. Finite Condition Numbers
XSA+LAKER provides measurable conditioning:
- **Range:** 20-90 (task dependent)
- **Trend:** Increases with sequence length
- **Result:** Even at 256 tokens, no accuracy benefit detected despite better conditioning

---

## Interpretation

### Why No Benefit?

The tested tasks don't leverage XSA+LAKER's theoretical advantages:

1. **Short sequences (≤64 tokens):** Self-exclusion matters less at short range
2. **Small vocabularies (100 tokens):** Easy embedding learning
3. **Synthetic patterns:** Don't require true reasoning or multi-hop inference
4. **No long-context dependency:** Tasks solvable with local attention

### Where Benefits Might Appear

1. **Very long sequences (512-2048 tokens):**
   - Tested up to 256 tokens with no benefit
   - May still emerge at 512+ tokens
   - Standard attention degradation not yet observed

2. **Real NLP with semantic structure:**
   - Tested synthetic sentiment with no benefit
   - IMDB or other real datasets may differ
   - True semantic dependencies not captured in synthetic tasks

3. **Numerically sensitive tasks:**
   - Multi-hop reasoning chains
   - Arithmetic or logical operations
   - Tasks requiring precise computation

## Recommendations

### For Production Use
1. **Default to standard attention** - No accuracy loss, 5x faster
2. **Try fused for final training** - If quality > speed
3. **Consider hybrid** - Fused in later layers only

### For Research
1. **Test 512+ token sequences** - Only remaining untested regime
2. **Evaluate on GLUE/SQuAD** - Real NLP benchmarks with semantic structure
3. **Ablation study** - Separate XSA from LAKER contributions
4. **Hyperparameter sweep** - Iterations, rank, kernel type
5. **Consider hybrid** - Fused only in later layers or for specific heads

**Conclusion:** The implementation is production-ready and mathematically correct. After 10 comprehensive benchmarks spanning easy synthetic tasks, hard algorithmic challenges, NLP sentiment classification, and sequence lengths from 32-256 tokens, XSA+LAKER shows **no measurable accuracy benefit** over standard attention. The consistent 3-7x slowdown (improving to ~3x at longer sequences) combined with equivalent accuracy suggests standard attention should be the default choice. Remaining untested regimes: 512+ token sequences and real NLP benchmarks with genuine semantic dependencies.
