    """Check that a tensor contains only finite values.

    The check is a single :func:`torch.isfinite` reduction across
    the entire tensor. On failure, the function can either raise
    a :class:`ValueError` with a precise breakdown (number of
    ``NaN``s, ``+Inf``s, and ``-Inf``s) or simply return
    ``False`` for non-raising callers. The breakdown is computed
    only on the error path, so the hot path is a single reduction
    regardless of the answer.

    Args:
        x: Tensor to check. Any dtype is accepted, but the check
            is most meaningful for floating-point tensors; integer
            tensors are always finite.
        name: Human-readable name used in error messages to
            identify which tensor failed. Defaults to
            ``"tensor"``.
        raise_error: When ``True`` (the default), raise
            :class:`ValueError` on the first non-finite sample.
            When ``False``, return ``False`` and stay silent -
            useful for callers that prefer to log and continue.

    Returns:
        ``True`` if every entry of ``x`` is finite. ``False`` if
        any entry is non-finite and ``raise_error`` is ``False``.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If ``raise_error`` is ``True`` and ``x``
            contains at least one ``NaN``, ``+Inf``, or
            ``-Inf``. The message reports the per-kind counts
            and the tensor's shape.

    Example:
        >>> x = torch.randn(10, 10)
        >>> finite(x)  # Returns True
        >>> x[0, 0] = float('inf')

    """Clamp a tensor to a closed interval.

    A small wrapper over :func:`torch.clamp` that treats
    ``None`` for either bound as "no bound on that side". When
    both bounds are ``None`` the function returns ``x`` itself,
    with no copy. The returned tensor is a fresh tensor whenever
    at least one bound is supplied.

    The ``name`` argument is accepted for API symmetry with
    :func:`finite` and is not used inside the function -
    it exists so callers can swap the two helpers without
    changing their call sites.

    Args:
        x: Tensor to clamp.
        min_val: Lower bound. ``None`` means "no lower bound".
        max_val: Upper bound. ``None`` means "no upper bound".
        name: Name for logging. Currently unused; preserved for

        A tensor of the same shape and dtype as ``x`` with values
        clipped to ``[min_val, max_val]``. The result shares
        storage with ``x`` only when no clamp is applied; any
        actual clamping produces a new tensor.
